## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with Vite
- **UI Components**: Custom components with responsive design
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Visualization**: Chart.js / Recharts for data visualization
- **Styling**: CSS Modules / Styled Components
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
- **Internationalization**: i18next for multilingual support
- **Mock Backend**: Simulated API with realistic data models
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## üèõ Architecture

The MEX Assistant follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

<img src="./assets/sys-arch.png" alt="MEX Assistant Logo" width="3840"/>


1. **UI Layer**: React components for rendering the interface
2. **State Management**: React Context API for global state
3. **Service Layer**: API interaction and data processing
4. **Data Layer**: Mock services (replaced by real APIs in production)

### Key Architectural Decisions:

- **Component Modularity**: Each UI component is self-contained with its own styles and logic
- **Context Separation**: Different contexts for chat, dashboard, and app-wide state
- **Responsive Design**: Fluid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Mock Service Layer**: Simulates backend while maintaining realistic architecture

## üì• Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ziflhigan/mex-assistant-frontend.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd mex-assistant-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file based on .env.example
cp .env.example .env

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

## üöÄ Usage

Once installed, you can:

1. **Launch the application**: Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
2. **Switch between views**: Use the sidebar to navigate between Dashboard and Chat
3. **Interact with the AI Assistant**: Ask business questions in the chat interface
4. **Explore the dashboard**: View charts and metrics for business performance
5. **Change the merchant**: Select different merchant accounts from the sidebar
6. **Adjust time periods**: Filter data by Today, Week, Month, or Year

### Example Interactions

Try asking the AI Assistant questions like:
- "Show me my top selling items this week"
- "What were my sales trends for this month?"
- "When are my busiest hours?"
- "How does my average order value compare to last week?"
- "What insights do you have for my business?"

## üîå API Integration

This prototype uses simulated data, but is designed for easy integration with real APIs:

### Service Layer
The `services` directory contains mock service functions that mimic API calls:

```javascript
// Current mock implementation 
export const getDashboardData = async ({ merchantId, timeFilter }) => {
  await delay(300); // Simulate network request
  return mockData[timeFilter][merchantId] || mockData[timeFilter].default;
};

// Future implementation would be:
export const getDashboardData = async ({ merchantId, timeFilter }) => {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/dashboard?merchantId=${merchantId}&period=${timeFilter}`);
  return response.json();
};
```

### API Endpoints
The application is designed to work with these API endpoints:
- `/api/dashboard` - Get dashboard statistics and metrics
- `/api/chat` - Process AI assistant interactions
- `/api/insights` - Retrieve AI-generated insights
- `/api/merchant` - Get merchant information

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for future versions:

- **Real AI Integration**: Replace mock responses with a real LLM-based agent
- **Live Data Connection**: Integrate with actual transaction data systems
- **Advanced Analytics**: Add predictive forecasting and deeper insights
- **Mobile App**: Develop a native mobile version for on-the-go access
- **Expanded Visualization**: Add more chart types and interactive elements
- **Notification System**: Proactive alerts for important business events
- **Voice Interface**: Add speech recognition for hands-free operation
